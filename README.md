# Parameter Optimization
## Introduction
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. They excel at finding hyperplanes in high-dimensional space that effectively separate data points belonging to different classes. This project explores the optimization of an SVM model for a specific classification problem.

The primary objective is to identify the best hyperparameter configuration for the SVM model using grid search. By tuning hyperparameters like regularization (C) and kernel coefficient (gamma), we aim to achieve optimal performance on unseen testing data. This approach helps us build a robust and generalizable classification model.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Letter Recognition dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset can be found at the [Letter Recognition Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition) on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It's a popular benchmark dataset for classification tasks involving handwritten character recognition.

The dataset consists of 20,000 samples, each representing a single handwritten letter. Each sample has 16 numeric features that describe various aspects of the letter image, such as the number of black pixels in specific regions. The target variable is the capital letter (A-Z) represented by the image.

This dataset provides a good example for exploring SVM model optimization due to its:

- **Moderate size:** It allows for efficient training and evaluation while offering enough data for generalization.
- **Structured data:** The features are numerical, making them suitable for direct use with SVM models.
- **Multi-class classification:** The dataset involves classifying 26 different letter classes, which is a typical scenario for SVM applications.

## Methodology
**1. Hyperparameter Tuning:**

- Grid search is employed to find the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM model. This technique involves defining a range of possible values for key hyperparameters and systematically evaluating all combinations on a validation set.
- The chosen hyperparameters for tuning are:
    - **C (regularization parameter):** Controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin (separating hyperplane) and minimizing training error. Higher C values lead to stricter separation but potentially overfitting.
    - **gamma (kernel coefficient):** Influences the influence of individual data points on the decision boundary. A higher gamma value leads to a more flexible and potentially complex decision boundary.

**2. Model Training and Evaluation:**

- The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the SVM model with different hyperparameter combinations from the grid search.
- The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data during the grid search process to avoid overfitting on the training data.
- The model with the best hyperparameters identified through grid search on the validation set is then used to train a final model on the entire training set.
- The final trained model is evaluated on the unseen testing set using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Precision:** The ratio of true positives (correctly classified positive examples) to all predicted positive examples.
- **Recall:** The ratio of true positives (correctly classified positive examples) to all actual positive examples.

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in identifying true positives and avoiding false positives/negatives.
