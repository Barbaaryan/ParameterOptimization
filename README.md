# Parameter Optimization
## Introduction
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. They excel at finding hyperplanes in high-dimensional space that effectively separate data points belonging to different classes. This project explores the optimization of an SVM model for a specific classification problem.

The primary objective is to identify the best hyperparameter configuration for the SVM model using grid search. By tuning hyperparameters like regularization (C) and kernel coefficient (gamma), we aim to achieve optimal performance on unseen testing data. This approach helps us build a robust and generalizable classification model.
