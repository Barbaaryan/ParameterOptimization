# Parameter Optimization
## Introduction
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. They excel at finding hyperplanes in high-dimensional space that effectively separate data points belonging to different classes. This project explores the optimization of an SVM model for a specific classification problem.

The primary objective is to identify the best hyperparameter configuration for the SVM model using grid search. By tuning hyperparameters like regularization (C) and kernel coefficient (gamma), we aim to achieve optimal performance on unseen testing data. This approach helps us build a robust and generalizable classification model.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Letter Recognition dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset can be found at the [Letter Recognition Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition) on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It's a popular benchmark dataset for classification tasks involving handwritten character recognition.

The dataset consists of 20,000 samples, each representing a single handwritten letter. Each sample has 16 numeric features that describe various aspects of the letter image, such as the number of black pixels in specific regions. The target variable is the capital letter (A-Z) represented by the image.

This dataset provides a good example for exploring SVM model optimization due to its:

- **Moderate size:** It allows for efficient training and evaluation while offering enough data for generalization.
- **Structured data:** The features are numerical, making them suitable for direct use with SVM models.
- **Multi-class classification:** The dataset involves classifying 26 different letter classes, which is a typical scenario for SVM applications.
